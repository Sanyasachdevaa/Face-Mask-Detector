# Face-Mask-Detector

COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly affected our day-to-day life disrupting the world trade and movements. Wearing a protective face mask has become a new normal and we are now in an era where public service providers are asking the customers to wear masks correctly to avail of their services. Moreover, it has also become necessary to ensure people wearing mask everywhere in public to put the spread of this diseases to stop. Therefore, face mask detection has become a crucial task to help global society. This project aims at presenting a simple approach to achieve the purpose of identifying people wearing face mask i.e., face mask detection using some machine learning algorithms and packages. The method will work in such a way that it will detect the face from the image correctly and then identify if it has a mask on it or not. We will also explore optimized values of parameters to detect the presence of masks correctly without causing over-fitting.

• Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time.
• Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin.
• When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it’s a
fabric mask, or dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin.
• Don’t use masks with valves.

Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, breathing, and coughing. A face covering without vents or holes will also filter out particles containing the virus from inhaled and exhaled air, reducing the chances of infection.
But, if the mask include an exhalation valve, a wearer that is infected (maybe without having noticed that, and asymptomatic) would transmit the virus outwards through it, despite any certification they can have.

So the masks with exhalation valve are not for the infected wearers, and are not reliable to stop the pandemic in a large scale. Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face masks or cloth face coverings by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus.

N95 respirators and surgical masks are examples of personal protective equipment that are used to protect the wearer from particles or from liquid contaminating the face. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) also regulates N95 respirators. The Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulates entities for compliance with worker safety rules and OSHA standards, including, for example, the proper use of respirators in different work environments.

It is important to recognize that the optimal way to prevent transmission of microorganisms, such as viruses, is to use a combination of interventions from across the hierarchy of controls, not just PPE alone. COVID-19 Resources on Respirators and Masks.

Most N95 respirators are manufactured for use in construction and other industrial type jobs that expose workers to dust and small particles. They are regulated by the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) in the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which is part of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

However, some N95 respirators are intended for use in a healthcare setting. Specifically, single-use, disposable respiratory protective devices used and worn by healthcare personnel during procedures to protect both the patient and healthcare personnel from the transfer of microorganisms, body fluids, and particulate material. These surgical N95 respirators are class II devices regulated by the FDA, under 21 CFR 878.4040, and CDC NIOSH under 42 CFR Part 84.

N95s respirators regulated under product code MSH are class II medical devices exempt from 510(k) premarket notification, unless:
• The respirator is intended to prevent specific diseases or infections, or
• The respirator is labelled or otherwise represented as filtering surgical smoke or plumes, filtering specific amounts of viruses or bacteria, reducing the amount of and/or killing viruses, bacteria, or fungi, or affecting allergenicity, or
• The respirator contains coating technologies unrelated to filtration (e.g., to reduce and or kill microorganisms).
The FDA has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with CDC NIOSH which outlines the framework for coordination and collaboration between the FDA and NIOSH for regulation of this subset of N95 respirators.

Product Perspective
Covid -19 has affected the world seriously. One major protection method for people is to wear masks in public areas. Furthermore, many public service providers require customers to use the service only if theywear masks correctly.
This product accomplishes the following:
Product Functions
The functions that the product will perform are:
• Facial images will be classified into masked and non-masked
• A red box will appear on the faces which are non-masked in real time • A green box will appear on the faces which are masked in real time
